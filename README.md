# EGU 2026 — Adding reactive-transport capabilities to the 2DSOIL model by integrating PhreeqcRM

Companion repository for the EGU 2026 conference presentation. It contains
self-contained codebases that exercise a coupled **2DSOIL ↔ PhreeqcRM**
reactive-transport model and verify it against independent references —
analytical solutions for simple kinetics, and PHREEQC's standalone
transport solver (IPhreeqc) for multi-species cation-exchange columns.

The repository is organised as a monorepo. Each top-level numbered folder
is one self-contained study / codebase, with its own modified Fortran glue,
its own `.pqi` chemistry inputs, and its own pre-built binaries.

## 1_BENCHMARKING_STUDY — analytical-solution benchmark

Three exercises were performed against analytical references:

| # | Scenario                                 | Reaction terms                              |
|---|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Conservative transport (no reaction)     | none                                        |
| 2 | First-order decay of species A           | μ = 3 × 10⁻⁶ mol/sec                        |
| 3 | First-order decay + zero-order production| μ = 3 × 10⁻⁶ mol/sec, γ = 1 × 10⁻⁶ mol/sec  |

For Cases 2 and 3, μ (decay rate) and γ (zero-order production) are set in
the visualization / error-calculation Python scripts.

```

### Components

- **2DSOIL** — Fortran finite-element soil-water/solute solver.
- **MAIZSIM** — C++ crop model, linked as a DLL.
- **PhreeqcRM** — USGS reactive-transport library (`PhreeqcRM.dll`).
- The Fortran ↔ C++ bridge to PhreeqcRM lives in
  `soil source/PhreeqcRM.FOR` and `soil source/RM_interface.F90`.

### Pre-built binaries

So the model can run on a target Windows x64 PC without rebuilding,
the following are checked in:

- `Maizsim_PhreeqcRM/soil source/x64/Debug/2dMAIZSIM.exe`
- `Maizsim_PhreeqcRM/soil source/x64/Debug/Maizsim.dll`
- `Maizsim_PhreeqcRM/soil source/x64/Debug/PhreeqcRM.dll`, `PhreeqcRMd.dll`
- `Maizsim_PhreeqcRM/PHREEQCRM_BUILD/{Debug,Release}/PhreeqcRM*.{dll,lib,exp}`
- PHREEQC chemistry databases (`*.dat`) under
  `Maizsim_PhreeqcRM/PHREEQCRM_BUILD/database/`

### Inputs and outputs (run-time files in `soil source/x64/Debug/`)

| File                          | Role                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PHREEQCRM_FILENAME.txt`      | Input: name of the active `.pqi` chemistry runfile (Case 1 / 2 / 3). |
| `PHREEQCRM_RUNFILE_BENCHMARKING_CASE_{1,2,3}.pqi` | PhreeqcRM chemistry definitions per case.        |
| `FERTIGATION_SCHEDULE.txt`    | Input: dates / hours / solute-flux / water-flux for fertigation.     |
| `phreeqc.dat`, `Amm.dat`, `Amm_2DSOIL.dat` | PHREEQC thermodynamic databases.                        |
| `run.dat`, `runTEST_CASE_1.dat` | 2DSOIL run controllers.                                            |
| `TEST_CASE_BM/`, `TEST_CASE_BM_750CM/` | Soil and climate inputs for the benchmark grids.            |
| **`FERTIGATION_OUTPUT.txt`**  | **Main output** — concentrations of species A at every node where x = 0 (1-D profile), written at hour 0 of each day. |
| `PHREEQC_SPECIES_OUT.txt`     | PhreeqcRM species-concentration dump.                                |
| `PHREEQCRM_2DSOIL.chem.txt`, `PHREEQCRM_2DSOIL.log.txt` | PhreeqcRM-side chemistry / log output.      |

The `FERTIGATION_OUTPUT.txt` write is in
`soil source/FERTIGATION.FOR` (subroutine `FERTIGATION`, near line 124).
Columns: `NODE_NUM, TIME, DATE, HOUR, X, Y, CONC`.

### Run scenario

Per `INFO.txt`:

- **Days 1–5 (1–5 Jan 2024)** — media saturates, no solute applied.
- **Day 6 onwards** — solute is injected via the fertigation module; species A
  concentrations are written to `FERTIGATION_OUTPUT.txt` at hour 0 of each day.

### Visualization

Python scripts in `1_BENCHMARKING_STUDY/1_PHREEQC_BENCHMARKING_STUDY_1_ANALYTICAL_SOLUTION/`:

- `1_PHREEQC_2DSOIL_BENCHMARKING_SOLUTE_MOVEMENT.py` — Case 1 (no reaction).
- `2_PHREEQC_2DSOIL_BENCHMARKING_SOLUTE_BIODEGRADATION.py` — Cases 2 and 3
  (edit `mu` and `gamma` in the script to toggle between them).
- `3_PHREEQC_2DSOIL_BENCHMARKING_COMPARATIVE_CURVES.py` — comparative plots
  across all three cases.

Output figures (`Figure_1.png`, `PHREEQC_Benchmarking_Curves_*.{png,pdf,svg,eps}`)
are checked in alongside the scripts.

### Error metrics

`1_BENCHMARKING_STUDY/ERROR_CALCULATION/`:

- `ERROR_COMPUTATION_CASE_{1,2,3}_*.py` — per-case RMSE / MAE / SMAPE between
  simulated and analytical concentrations.
- `RESULTS_BENCHMARKING_ERROR_METRICS.{txt,xlsx}` — aggregated results.
- `COLUMN_SAMPLED_COORDINATES.xlsx` — sampling depths used for the metrics.

## 2_CATION_EXCHANGE_PROBLEM — multi-species cation-exchange column

A column-displacement / cation-exchange study in the spirit of PHREEQC's
classic *Example 11*: a soil column initially equilibrated with a Na–K–NO₃
solution (in equilibrium with an exchanger `X`) is flushed from the top
with a Ca–Cl solution. The exchanger releases Na⁺/K⁺, retains Ca²⁺, and the
five solutes (Ca²⁺, Cl⁻, Na⁺, K⁺, NO₃⁻) develop characteristic breakthrough
profiles down the column.

The 2DSOIL ↔ PhreeqcRM result is benchmarked **against IPhreeqc** (PHREEQC's
standalone transport solver) running the same chemistry on the same grid —
not against an analytical solution. Reference output files live in
`2_PHREEQC_APPLICATION_CATION_EXCHANGE/` as `IPHREEQC_OUTPUT_*.sel` and the
combined comparison spreadsheets `RESULTS_100cm_1cm*.xlsx`.

### Chemistry (`PHREEQCRM_RUNFILE_CATION_EXCHANGE.pqi`)

| Block             | Contents                                                                |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SOLUTION 0`      | Inflow at the top boundary: Ca = 0.0006 mol/L, Cl = 0.0012 mol/L, pH 7. |
| `SOLUTION 1–500`  | Initial column water: Na = 0.001, K = 0.0002, N(5)=NO₃ = 0.0012 mol/L.  |
| `EXCHANGE 0`      | Cation exchanger `X`, total sites 0.0011 eq/L, equilibrated with cell 1; copied to cells 1–500. |
| `SELECTED_OUTPUT` | Writes pH, pe, charge balance, % error, totals (O Ca Cl K N X), Eh.     |

### Differences from `1_BENCHMARKING_STUDY` (do not assume parity)

- **`PhreeqcRM.FOR`** has the runfile **hardcoded** to
  `"PHREEQCRM_RUNFILE_CATION_EXCHANGE.pqi"` (lines 182, 653) — there is
  **no** `PHREEQCRM_FILENAME.txt` in this codebase.
- **`FERTIGATION.FOR`** is the multi-solute version. Solute 2 inflow is
  auto-set to `2 × (35.453 / 40.08) × solute_1` so the Cl⁻ flux balances
  the Ca²⁺ flux on a charge / molar-equivalent basis.
- **Output is now CSV-formatted, sampled at `x = 5.0` cm** (column interior,
  not the surface), at **every step** (the hour-0 filter is commented out).
  Columns: `NODE_NUM, TIME, DATE, HOUR, X, Y, MMOLS_1, … MMOLS_5` where
  `MMOLS_i = Conc(I,i) / MW_i` with MW = 40.08, 35.453, 22.9898, 39.102,
  62.01 for Ca²⁺, Cl⁻, Na⁺, K⁺, NO₃⁻ respectively.
- **`FERTIGATION_SCHEDULE.txt`** uses solute flux 24.0, water flux 1.0 cm/day
  (vs 1000.0 / 5.0 in codebase 1), with three identical fertigation events.
- **`2DMAIZSIM.FOR`** also differs from codebase 1.

### Variant `.pqi` runfiles checked in

In `Maizsim_PhreeqcRM/soil source/x64/Debug/`:

| File                                                       | Purpose                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **`PHREEQCRM_RUNFILE_CATION_EXCHANGE.pqi`**                | **Active runfile** (hardcoded in `PhreeqcRM.FOR`).       |
| `PHREEQCRM_RUNFILE_BASIC_KINETICS_27_11_2024.pqi`          | Earlier kinetics-only experiment.                        |
| `PHREEQCRM_RUNFILE_SOLUTIONS_ONLY_26_NOV_2024.pqi`         | Solutions only — no exchanger.                           |
| `PHREEQCRM_RUNFILE_DECOUPLED.pqi`                          | Decoupled / diagnostic variant.                          |
| `PHREEQCRM_RUNFILE_TEST_CASE_SEQ_RXN.pqi`                  | Sequential-reactions test.                               |
| `PHREEQCRM_RUNFILE_BENCHMARKING_STUDY_1.pqi`               | Carry-over from codebase 1 (kept for reference).         |

To switch the active runfile, edit the literal string in
`soil source/PhreeqcRM.FOR` at lines 182 and 653 and rebuild.

### Run scenario

The 2DSOIL-PhreeqcRM run uses the same `Maizsim_PhreeqcRM/soil source/x64/Debug/2dMAIZSIM.exe`
binary that codebase 1 uses (rebuilt against the modified Fortran). The
fertigation schedule injects Ca/Cl water at the top of the column for the
duration of the simulation (Jan 2024 dates in `FERTIGATION_SCHEDULE.txt`),
and concentrations at `x = 5.0` cm are written to `FERTIGATION_OUTPUT.txt`
every step in mmol/L for all five species.

### Error metrics

`2_CATION_EXCHANGE_PROBLEM/ERROR_CALCULATION/`:

- `ERROR_CALCULATION_CATION_EXCHANGE.py` — RMSE / MAE / SMAPE between
  2DSOIL-PhreeqcRM and IPhreeqc, per species.
- `RESULTS_100cm_1cm_ALL_NODES.xlsx` — input data the script reads.
- `ERROR.xlsx` — aggregated metrics.

## Running the pre-built `2dMAIZSIM.exe`

Both codebases ship a pre-built executable so you can reproduce the runs
without rebuilding. The executable reads **all of its inputs from the current
working directory** (run controllers, `.pqi` chemistry runfile, PHREEQC
databases, the fertigation schedule, the `TEST_CASE_BM*/` folders, etc.) and
writes its outputs into the same place.

### From a terminal or Explorer

Just launch the exe from inside its own `Debug/` directory:

```bash
# Codebase 1
cd "1_BENCHMARKING_STUDY/Maizsim_PhreeqcRM/soil source/x64/Debug"
./2dMAIZSIM.exe

# Codebase 2
cd "2_CATION_EXCHANGE_PROBLEM/Maizsim_PhreeqcRM/soil source/x64/Debug"
./2dMAIZSIM.exe
```

(or double-click `2dMAIZSIM.exe` in Explorer — Windows uses the file's parent
folder as CWD, which is what we want).

### From Visual Studio (F5 / Ctrl+F5) — required one-time fix

VS's default debug **Working Directory** is `$(ProjectDir)` — i.e.
`soil source/` — but the inputs and runtime DLLs live one level deeper, in
`$(IntDir)` = `soil source/x64/Debug/`. So an unmodified F5 launch will
fail to find `run.dat`, `phreeqc.dat`, `PHREEQCRM_RUNFILE_*.pqi`,
`FERTIGATION_SCHEDULE.txt`, `TEST_CASE_BM/`, etc.

To fix this **once per fresh clone, per project**:

1. Open the codebase's solution
   (`Maizsim_PhreeqcRM/maizsim07_PHREEQCRM.sln`) in Visual Studio.
2. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **`2dMAIZSIM`** project →
   **Properties**.
3. **Configuration Properties → Debugging → Working Directory** → set to
   `$(IntDir)`.
4. Click OK.

> **Why this isn't already set on a fresh clone**: Intel Fortran writes
> debug-session settings (working directory, command-line args, env vars) to
> a per-user file `2dMAIZSIM.vfproj.<WINDOWS-USERNAME>.user`. Those files
> are excluded by `.gitignore` because they normally contain personal paths
> and would conflict between machines. The `$(IntDir)` setting therefore
> persists locally for you, but doesn't travel with the repo. Each new
> clone needs the one-time fix above.

A terminal / double-click launch (above) does **not** need this fix — the
working-directory issue only affects F5/Ctrl+F5 from inside Visual Studio.

---

## Building from source

Each codebase ships its **own** Visual Studio solution and PhreeqcRM build
folder, because the Fortran sources differ between studies:

- `1_BENCHMARKING_STUDY/Maizsim_PhreeqcRM/maizsim07_PHREEQCRM.sln`
- `2_CATION_EXCHANGE_PROBLEM/Maizsim_PhreeqcRM/maizsim07_PHREEQCRM.sln`

PhreeqcRM has its own build folder `PHREEQCRM_BUILD/` inside each codebase
(CMake-generated VS solution).

Toolchain used:

- Visual Studio 2022 (`v143` platform toolset)
- Intel oneAPI Fortran Compiler (`ifx`) for the 2DSOIL Fortran project
- CMake 3.30 (used to (re)generate each `PHREEQCRM_BUILD/` folder)

The Fortran linker is configured to pick up `maizsim.lib` from the C++
project's output and `PhreeqcRM.lib` from `PHREEQCRM_BUILD/Release/`
(see `soil source/2dMAIZSIM.vfproj`, configuration `Debug|x64`).

### Runtime requirements on the target PC

The shipped EXE is dynamically linked against:

- **Intel Fortran runtime** (`libifcoremd.dll`, `libifportmd.dll`, …) — install
  via the Intel oneAPI HPC Toolkit (or its redistributable runtime package).
- **Microsoft Visual C++ 2015–2022 Redistributable (x64)**.

Both are vendor components and are **not** redistributable through this repo.

## License

The vendored PhreeqcRM source under each codebase's
`Maizsim_PhreeqcRM/PHREEQCRM/phreeqcrm-master/` retains its original USGS
license (see that folder's own license / notice files). The 2DSOIL and
MAIZSIM components retain the licenses of their upstream projects.
